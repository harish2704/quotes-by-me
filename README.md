Nothing... Just for fun

## The list

### Software development

1. **Compilations are the result of bad design decisions**
    - Before trying to find a solution, turn back and check your design.
2. **Software development is nothing the but process of compiling an `Idea` or `concept` described in a high-level language to low-level language generally known as `source-code`**
    - Naturally, Idea should be well described for producing a good product. Because, dirty source-code will ofter cause bug in the application.
3. **Defining a fool-proof `protocol` or `interfaces` for interconnecting various parts of the application is the basic problem.**
2. **Technologies will come and go. But the `protocol` will remain **

### Philosophy
1. **Money is nothing but a `box` used to pack our `Hard-work`**
    - Size of the box doesn't matters really, but the weight of content does.
